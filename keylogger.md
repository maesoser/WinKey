## Keylogger for windows

A tiny Keylogger designed to be installed by using a USB pendrive and a batch script ( to copy the executable and create the auto start-up entry).
The program should register the keystrokes on a file and open a port on the victim. Another guy on the same local network or knowing the
IP of the victim should be able to connect to that port and receive the written text.
